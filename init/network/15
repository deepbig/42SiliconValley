#15) Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

# You first need to vim (vim does not work because of the lack of permission) or sudo nano /etc/hosts file.
# add the line: 46.19.122.85 intra.42.fr
# expected result would be:
#       127.0.0.1       localhost
#       255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
#       ::1             localhost
#
#       #10.51.1.38 	cdn.intra.42.fr
#       45.19.122.85	intra.42.fr
