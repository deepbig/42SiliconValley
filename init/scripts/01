# 1) Write a script which displays only the login, UID and Path of each entry of the /etc/passwd file.

# /etc/password has seven fields: name, password, user ID, group ID, gecos, home directory and shell.
#Login(name), UID(user ID), Path(home directory).

cat /etc/passwd | awk -F : '{print $1 " "  $3 " " $6}'

# if you argues the path is the shell path... 
# here is the answer:

#cat /etc/passwd | awk -F : '{print $1 " " $3 " " $7}'
