# 01) Create a virtual machine with `docker-machine` using the `virtualbox` driver, and named `Char`.

# First, the difference between Docker Engine and Docker Machine.
# 1) Docker Engine: the client-server application, a REST API that specifies interfaces for interacting with the Docker daemon. It accepts `docker` commands (docker run <image>, docker ps, docker image ls, and so on)
# 2) Docker Machine: a tool for provisioning and managing your Dockerized hosts. It installed in local system, and use `docker-machine` commands. You can use Machine to install Docker Engine on one or more virtual systems. 

# docker-machine create
# --driver: `create` reqires `--driver` flag to indicate which provider(VirtualBox, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc) the machine should be created on, and an argument to indicate the name of the created machine. 

docker-machine create --driver virtualbox Char

# To check the result:
# docker-machine ls
