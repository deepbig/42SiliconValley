# 03) Define the variables needed by your virtual machine `Char` in the genera; env of your terminal, so that you can run the `docker ps` command without errors. You have to fix all four environment variables with one command, and you are not allowed to use your shell's builtin to set these variables by hand.

# docker-machine env: set environment variables to dictate that `docker` should run a command agianst particular machine.
# eval: execute arguments as a shell command.

eval $(docker-machine env Char)

#To check the result:
# env | grep DOCKER

#To unset the env variables:
# eval $(docker-machine env -u)
