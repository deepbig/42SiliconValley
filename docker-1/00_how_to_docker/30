# 30) Increase the number of copies of the `marines` service up to twenty, because there's never enough Marines to eliminate Zergs. (Remember to take a look at the tasks and logs of the service, you'll see, it's fun.)

# docker service:
# 	scale: scale one or multiple replicated services.
#	docker service scale SERVICE=REPLICAS [SERVICE=REPLICAS...]
#	--detach, -d: Exit immediately instead of waiting for the service to converge.

docker service scale -d marines=20

# to check the log:
# docker service logs -f $(docker service ps marines -f "name=marines.11" -q)
