# 22) Turn `Aiur` into a slave of the local swarm in which `Char` is leader (the command to take control of `Aiur is not requested).

# Log into or run a command on a machine using SSH.
# docker-mashine ssh machine-name

# Join as a worker node (https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/join-nodes/#join-as-a-worker-node)
# Once you type: $ docker swarm join-token worker
# 	it will give you output of token.
# 	Copy and paste like:
# 	$ docker swarm join \
# 	--token (given output)

# That's it!

# !! When you run it in the manager node, it does not works. You should use this in the worker node!

# --quiet, -q: only display token.
